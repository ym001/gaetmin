Gaetmin release Note :

What is Gaetmin?

******************

Gaetmin is a random generator minimum entropy time and Gaetmin written in java with the win32 API.

Why another random generator?

**************************


A random number generator, random number generator (RNG) in English, is a device capable of producing a sequence of numbers which can not be "easily" take deterministic properties
Since the Pentium III and 4, Intel integrates with all chipsets i8xx family (i815, i820, i840, i845, i860 ...) a random number generator based on thermal noise integrated circuits. The principle is based on the behavior of any electrical component traversed by a current: electrons are agitated randomly, producing a "thermal noise" (thermal noise, or Johnson noise in English) that varies the voltage measured at its terminals.
The advantage of this system lies in its cost, especially in speed of about 75 kbits / sec.

When needs some random bits, may be used the least significant bit of any timer. It is gaetmin.
